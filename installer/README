Apache Flex
Copyright 2012 The Apache Software Foundation

Overview:

- The InstallApacheFlex AIR application is intended to provide an easy, single-click installation of the Apache Flex SDK and all its dependencies.  
- This will make it suitable for working with IDEs such as Flash Builder, FDT, IntelliJ, FlashDevelop, etc.  
	The downloaded dependencies include:
	 - The AIR sdk (Windows vs. Mac) based on the current platform
	 - FlashPlayerGlobal.swc
	 - SwfObject
	 - OSMF
	 - TLF
	 
	Optionally, the application would download these files if the user explicitly agrees:
	 - BlazeDS
	 - FontSWF utility
 
	All the file names and urls of the downloaded files are available in installer/src/sdk-installer-config.xml. 
	When the dependencies file names or urls change in future, update the sdk-installer-config.xml to ensure that the application works correctly.  

- The application uses http://incubator.apache.org/flex/single-mirror-url.cgi to determine the preferred mirror url to download Apache Flex SDK binary from.
- Once the Apache Flex SDK binary file is downloaded, a MD5 has is generated from it.  This hash is compared with the hash from the Apache Flex SDK release site.  
	If they match, we verify that the downloaded binary file is a valid Apache release and proceed to unzip the file.  
- The AIR SDK will downloaded and the relevant files are copied to the required locations
- The Flash player global swc files and the config files are placed in the required locations
- Then the rest of the external dependencies and the optional files (if selected by user) are downloaded and copied into the appropriate locations.  

Prerequisites and dependencies:

1.  This project also needs the project 'common' that is in the source distribution.  Make sure that the 'common' project lives in the same directory as the 'installer' project is.  
Just unzipping the source distribution would normally take care of this.  

2.  Run: ant get-as3commons.swc
This step downloads the required libraries and saves it in the libs directory

3.  In Flash Builder, add a linked resource called: APACHE_FLEX_UTILITIES_ROOT and point it to the directory path where the projects: 'installer' and 'common' are located.
