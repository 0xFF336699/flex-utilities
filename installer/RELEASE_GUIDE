Steps to follow in preparation for a release of InstallApacheFlex

1.    Check out the code from https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/flex/utilities/trunk

2.a.  If it is a major release, 
		- bump up the "release.version" property in the build.properties file 
		- reset the build.number property in the build.number file to 0

2.b.  If it is a minor release, run: ant update-version

3.  Open build.properties and update the following:
	- Modify the KEYSTORE_DIR and CERT_PASSWORD_DIR variables with the correct directory paths
	(You need to obtain the installapacheflex_self.p12 file and its password from the previous release manager for InstallApacheFlex)
	
4.  Run: 
ant release

This step 
	- downloads all the necessary files, 
	- updates the version numbers in InstallApacheFlex-app.xml and sdk-installer-config.xml
	- creates the .exe or .dmg file depending on the OS you are working on
	- creates the source release files as a .zip file and a tar.gz file 
	
5.  Run:

cd release

gpg --armor --output apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-bin.exe.asc --detach-sig apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-bin.exe
gpg --armor --output apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc --detach-sig apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.tar.gz
gpg --armor --output apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.zip.asc --detach-sig apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.zip

This step creates the release artifacts InstallApacheFlex.exe.asc, apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc and apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.zip.asc

6.  Run:
gpg --print-md MD5 apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-bin.exe > apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-bin.exe.md5
gpg --print-md MD5 apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.tar.gz > apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.tar.gz.md5
gpg --print-md MD5 apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.zip > apache-flex-sdk-installer-1.0.8-incubating-src.zip.md5

7. In the /installer directory, run:
ant rat-report

This step creates the rat.report file.  Inspect the report to make sure there are no violations.  

8. Upload all the files under the /release directory to the release manager's personal space at people.apache.org before calling a VOTE.
